# LatexSVG

This is a small package that renders LaTeX as SVG by utilizing the `dvisvgm` executable bundled with all major LaTeX distributions. It allows you to set custom preambles and is capable of rendering any LaTeX code that is considered valid by the `xelatex`, `pdflatex` or `lualatex` engine, and is thus much more flexible and powerful than javascript-based alternatives like `mathjax` or `KaTeX`.
